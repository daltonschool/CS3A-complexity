Write the name of each sort in the column that describes its average behavior. In each case n represents the number of data items to be sorted.


               | O(n) | O(n lg n) | O(n2)
---------------|------|-----------|--------
Bucket sort    |      |           |
Bubble Sort    |      |           |
Insertion Sort |      |           |
Merge Sort     |      |           |
Quick Sort     |      |           |


1.  Which of the sorts listed above are guaranteed to be very fast ( O(n) ) on lists that are already sorted?


2.  Which of the sorts listed above are guaranteed to be ( O(n lg n) ) or better on all long lists?


3.  What is the limitation on the Bucket sort that restricts its use?


4.  If a Bubble sort takes 3 seconds to sort 5,000 items on a certain computer system, estimate how long it will take to sort 20,000 items.


5.  If a Merge sort takes 15 Âµseconds to sort 32,000 items on a certain computer system, estimate how long it will take to sort 64,000 items.
