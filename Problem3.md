Write the name of each sort in the column that describes its average behavior. In each case n represents the number of data items to be sorted.


   | O(n) | O(n lg n) | O(n2)
------------------------------
Bucket sort |  |  |
Bubble Sort |  |  |
Insertion Sort |  |  |
Merge Sort |  |  |
Quick Sort |  |  |




Which of the sorts listed would be reasonable for sorting a list of 200,000 items?


Which of the sorts listed above are guaranteed to be very fast ( O(n) ) on lists that are already sorted?


Which of the sorts listed above are guaranteed to be ( O(n lg n) ) or better on all long lists?


What is the limitation on the Bucket sort that restricts its use?


If a Bubble sort takes 3 seconds to sort 5,000 items on a certain computer system, estimate how long it will take to sort 20,000 items.


If a Merge sort takes 15 Âµseconds to sort 32,000 items on a certain computer system, 
estimate how long it will take to sort 64,000 items.
