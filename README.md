==============

This is the algorithic complexity problem set.

## Getting Started

To download the files to your local machine 
```
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
```
see [fetching a remote](https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote) for more information.

## Tracking and Syncing changes

As you make changes you will need to track them with commits.  You will also need to sync your changes to github.

```
$ git status
```
Lists all new or modified files to be commited
```
$ git add [file]
```
adds the listed file to the staging area
```
$ git reset [file]
```
Unstages the file, but preserve its contents
```
$ git diff
```
Shows file differences not yet staged
```
$ git diff --staged
```
Shows file differences between staging and the last file version
```
$ git commit -m "[descriptive message]"
```
Records file snapshots permanently in version history. The -a option adds all tracked files to the commit.  If you include "fixes #2" in the message, github will link to and close issue #2.
```
$ git stash
```
Temporarily stores all modified tracked files
```
$ git pull
```
fetches any changes from github and merges them with your code
```
$ git push
``` 
sends all of your commits to github

## Assignment

Due 10/30.

There are a number of issues that you can attempt to resolve for this assignment.  Each correctly resolved and closed issue is worth five points.  We will give you 70 points as a curve.  The maximum score is 95.

This assignment is to be completed on your own WITHOUT the use of internet resources.  You MAY use the notes from class.

You may work in teams of up to two people, if you like.  If you work together, it us your responsibility to make sure that both people understand all of your answers.  I will check this, and if it is not true both students will lose the points from their assignment.  

You must push your commits to github.  No other submissions are required.  You *may* check your account at github.com to make sure your files are online.
