CSA-complexity
==============

This is the algorithic complexity problem set.

##Getting Started

configure your local git instance
```
git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"
```

To download the files to your local machine 
```
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
```
see [fetching a remote](https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote) for more information.

## Tracking and Syncing changes

As you make changes you will need to track them with commits.  You will also need to sync your changes to github.

```
$ git commit -a -m "descriptive message, fixes #1"
```

Records file snapshots permanently in version history. The -a option adds all tracked files to the commit.  If you include "fixes #2" in the message, github will link to and close issue #2.

```
$ git push
``` 
sends all of your commits to github
